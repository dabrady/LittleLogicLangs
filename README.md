Little Logic Languages
======================

Project files for miniKanren language levels, as outlined in my paper, _[Little Logic Languages for Relational Programming](http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2014/papers/Brady2014.pdf)_, presented at the Scheme and Functional Programming Workshop of 2014. From the abstract:

> The miniKanren relational programming language, though designed and used as a
> language with which to teach relational programming, can be immensely
> frustrating when it comes to debugging programs, especially when the
> programmer is a novice. In order to address the varying levels of programmer
> sophistication, we introduce a suite of different language levels. We
> introduce the first of these languages, and provide experimental results that
> demonstrate its effectiveness in helping beginning programmers discover and
> prevent mistakes.

Project files for miniKanren language levels.

The miniKanren relational programming language, though designed and used as a
language with which to teach relational programming, can be immensely
frustrating when it comes to debugging programs, especially when the
programmer is a novice. In order to address the varying levels of programmer
sophistication, we introduce a suite of different language levels. We
introduce the first of these languages, and provide experimental results that
demonstrate its effectiveness in helping beginning programmers discover and
prevent mistakes.
